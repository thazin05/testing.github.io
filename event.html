									<p>In Kalaw and the heavens were joining in, it poured from the sky – no need for water pistols on the first day. In fact, due to the roads we took, we didn’t see much of the festival. On the next morning we went on a 20km hike through the local hillside to see monasteries and some small villages. Due to the fact we were hiking, we left our water pistols at the hotel. The first couple of hours were spent walking through fields and learning about the local fauna and flora, watching animals and people whilst tasting fruit and vegetables found on the way. </p>
